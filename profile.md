  content: It's me, John Daniel Norombaba. The most consistent, organized, and yet
    chaotic spirit on Frontier's campus. I'm running again for rally commissioner
    because, I want to keep delivering rallies <em>with more energy than nuclear power
    plants.</em> That's not rocket science, that's a John Daniel guarantee!

  headline: "<strong>I don't just talk the talk, I type the type.</strong>"
  content: Since I became rally commissioner, every rally has started with this. It's
    not just made to work out, it's made with the intent for you to have the best
    time at a rally. Comprehensive, organized, and ready for admin-approval. <strong>Every.
    Single. Time.</strong> And if something needs to be added in, you betcha' I can
    make that happen, we can make that happen!
